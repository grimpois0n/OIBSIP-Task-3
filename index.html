    <h2 class="bioh">Biography</h2>
    <p class="biop">Bjarne Stroustrup, born on December 30, 1950, in Aarhus, Denmark, 
        is a renowned computer scientist best known as the creator of 
        the C++ programming language. After obtaining his Master's
        degree in mathematics and computer science, Stroustrup joined
        Bell Labs in 1979, where he developed C++ as an extension of 
        the C programming language, introducing object-oriented 
        programming concepts. C++ became widely adopted, 
        revolutionizing software development. Stroustrup has held 
        academic positions, authored influential books on C++, and 
        received awards for his contributions. His enduring impact on 
        programming and computer science continues through teaching, 
        research, and active participation in the programming community.</p>
